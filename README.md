<h2>About Node Revision Delete Drupal Module</h2>

The Node Revision Delete module allows you to manage the revisions of the Node according to your choice. It helps you to keep the specific number of revisions for the node. This module provides you the flexibility for applying the revision delete for the specific content type and run it on the specific time. You can manage your settings from the Node Revision Delete Administration Page.

The reason for creating this type of project that I searched the drupal modules for deleting the node revisions for Drupal 7, but I did not get any module. So I wrote a very simple and small application module to do this operation.

This is the drupal full project. You can also download it from drupal site.
