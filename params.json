It helps you to keep the specific number of revisions for the node. This module provides you the flexibility for applying the revision delete for the specific content type and run it on the specific time. You can manage your settings from the Node Revision Delete Administration Page.\r\n\r\nThe reason for creating this type of project that I searched the drupal modules for deleting the node revisions for Drupal 7, but I did not get any module. So I wrote a very simple and small application module to do this operation.\r\n\r\nThis is the drupal full project. You can also download it from drupal site. \r\n<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/node_revision_delete\" target=\"_blank\">Node Revision Delete</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>What the Node Module Revision Does:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Facilitates users to set the number of revisions to keep</li>\r\n<li>Users can run the revisions deletion operation for specific content type</li>\r\n<li>Facilitates users to set the cron timing to execute the script</li>\r\n<li>The predefined time slicings are:</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Run Now Only</li>\r\n<li>Everyday</li>\r\n<li>Every Week</li>\r\n<li>Every 10 Days</li>\r\n<li>Every 15 Days</li>\r\n<li>Every Month</li>\r\n<li>Every 3 Months</li>\r\n<li>Every 6 Months</li>\r\n<li>Every Year</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
